          <p>
            Thank you for choosing CreatorX SEO. We are committed to providing our customers with high-quality tools and services. Our primary goal is to ensure your satisfaction and help you achieve your content creation goals.
          </p>

          <h2>Digital Services</h2>
          <p>
            CreatorX SEO offers digital services, including subscription-based access to our tools and personalized guidance. Due to the nature of these digital services, our policy is as follows:
          </p>
          
          <h3>General Policy</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>All sales are final. We do not offer refunds for our subscription plans or any one-time services once the service has been rendered or the subscription period has begun.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            When you purchase a subscription, you are paying for access to our tools and services for the duration of the billing period (e.g., monthly). Because access is granted immediately and our AI tools incur costs on our end for every use, we cannot provide refunds for payments already made.
          </p>

          <h2>Subscription Cancellations</h2>
          <p>
            You are free to cancel your subscription at any time. To cancel, please contact us directly via WhatsApp or email through our <a href="/contact">Contact Us</a> page.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you cancel, your subscription will remain active until the end of your current paid billing cycle. You will not be charged for the next billing cycle. For example, if you are on a monthly plan and you cancel halfway through the month, you will retain access to the Pro features for the remainder of that month, and no further charges will be made.
          </p>

          <h2>Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
          <p>
            We understand that exceptional situations can occur. While our policy is no refunds, we may consider refunds on a case-by-case basis under very specific circumstances, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A demonstrable technical error on our part that prevented you from using the service for a significant portion of your billing period.</li>
            <li>Accidental duplicate billing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To request a review under exceptional circumstances, you must contact our support team within 7 days of the charge. We reserve the right to make the final decision on whether a refund is warranted.
          </p>
