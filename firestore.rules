/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @version 2
 *
 * @Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data stored under their specific user ID.
 *
 * @Data Structure:
 * All user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path. Each document represents a user profile.
 *
 * @Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create their own profile (self-registration).
 * - Users can only read, update, and delete their own profile.
 * - Listing all users is explicitly denied to protect user privacy.
 *
 * @Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` is part of the document path (`/users/{userId}`) and is also enforced as the `id` field inside the document. This redundancy (path + data) allows us to easily and securely validate ownership on both `create` and `update` operations.
